## Computer Setup

Since we will be working entirely at the Ohio Supercomputer Center (OSC),
and will be doing so **through our internet browsers**:

- You won't need to install anything
- Any operating system will work
- You won't need an especially powerful machine
  (though browsers, especially in combination with Zoom, can use their fair
  share of memory).

If you're attending **in person**, you will need to bring a _laptop_.
You can watch the presentation on a big screen in the room,
which will make it easier to code along (see below).
You won't need to connect to the Zoom call.

If you're attending **via Zoom**, we would recommend a _two-monitor setup_.
This is because much of the time,
you need to be able to simultaneously see the instructor's screen via Zoom
as well as your own browser window.

We'll use [this Google Doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1M_BSRtnG3QYjntpgxbMENr_ZJGrA35B1e7E0Dn0hK5Q/edit?usp=sharing) for sharing links and code, and for non-urgent questions.

## Miscellaneous info

#### Expect to participate!

The modules will be a mixture of lectures that include "_participatory_
_live-coding_"
(also called "code-along"; with the instructor slowly demonstrating and
participants expected to follow along for themselves)
and small _single-person exercises_ (we won't be doing breakout rooms / groups).
Therefore, be prepared to actively participate during much of the workshop!

#### Example data

We will mainly use a set of `FASTQ` files from a
[published RNAseq experiment](https://www.nature.com/articles/sdata2018290)
as example data.
(But it may be worth emphasizing that the exact data type matters relatively little for the purposes of our workshop,
since we focus on foundational skills and not specific genomic analyses.)

If you have any data yourself, you can bring it along and you should be able 
to experiment with it a bit in our second session on Friday afternoon.
If this is a large dataset (say, >10GB),
uploading it to OSC will take some time.
You could try to start this after Wednesday's sessions,
when you've had some background on this.
Alternatively, you can contact us prior to the workshop.
