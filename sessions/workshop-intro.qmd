## What you will and won't learn

The focus of the workshop is on building some **general skills** for analyzing
genomics data.

Command-line programs are preferred for many of the steps to analyze genomic
sequencing data.
Because such datasets tend to contain _a lot_ of data,
it is also preferable to run your analyses not on a laptop or desktop,
but at a compute cluster like the Ohio Supercomputer Center (OSC).

In combination, this means that you need the following set of skills that you
may not have been thought during your biology education:

1. Having a basic understanding of a **supercomputer** (compute cluster)

And being able to:

2. Use the **Unix shell** (work in a terminal)
3. Write small **shell scripts**
4. Activate and probably install **software** in a Linux environment where you
   don't have "admin rights"
5. Instead of simply executing your scripts,
   **submitting scripts** to a "queue" and monitor and managing the resulting
   compute jobs.

We will teach the basics of these skills during this workshop!

It may be useful to point out that given this focus, we will **not** teach you
much in the way of:

- Details of genomic data file types
- Details of specific (genomic) analyses
- Making biological inferences from your data

## Mechanics of a hybrid workshop

We have a slightly complicated set up with people in-person in Wooster with
one instructor, in-person in Columbus with another instructor,
and some people via Zoom. Some notes:

- **This website has all the material** that we will go through during each
  of the modules!
  See the links in the schedule as well as under the top bar menus.

- In-person participants don't need to connect to the Zoom call
  (but are of course allowed to connect,
  if they can better see the instructor's screen that way).

- Because we're not all on Zoom, we'll use
  **[this Google Doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1M_BSRtnG3QYjntpgxbMENr_ZJGrA35B1e7E0Dn0hK5Q/edit?usp=sharing)**
  to share links, inpromptu code that is not on the website,
  and non-urgent question.
  
- Whenever you have a **question**,
  please feel free to interrupt and speak up,
  both in-person and over Zoom.
  Only if your question is not urgent and you don't want to interrupt the flow,
  put it in the Google Doc or ask about it during a break.
