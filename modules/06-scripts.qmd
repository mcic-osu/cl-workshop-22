Shell scripts (or to be slightly more species, Bash scripts)
enable us to **run sets of commands non-interactively**.
This is especially beneficial or necessary when a set of commands:

  - Takes a long time to run and/or
  - Should be run many times, e.g. for different samples

Scripts form the basis for *analysis pipelines* and if we code things cleverly,
it should be straightforward to rerun much of our project workflow:
  
- After removing or adding a sample
- For different parameter settings
- And possibly even for an entirely different dataset.

## Script header lines and zombie scripts

### Shebang line

Use a so-called "_shebang_" line as the first line of a script
to **indicate which language your script use**.
More specifically, this line tell the computer where to find the binary
(executable) that will run your script.
  
Such a line starts with `#!`, basically marking it as a special type of comment. After that, we provide the location to the relevant program:
in our case Bash, which is always located at `/bin/bash` on Linux and Mac
computers.

```sh
#!/bin/bash
```

Adding a shebang line is good practice and is necessary when we want to submit
our script to OSC's `SLURM` queue, which we'll do tomorrow.

Another line that is good practice to add to your Bash scripts changes some
default settings to safer alternatives.

### Bash script settings

Two Bash default settings are bad ideas inside scripts.

_First_, and as we've seen in the previous module,
Bash does not complain when you
**reference a variable that does not exist**
(in other words, it does not consider that an error).

In scripts, this can lead to all sorts of downstream problems,
because you probably tried to do something with an existing variable
but made a typo.
Even more problematically,
it can lead to potentially very destructive file removal:

```{bash, eval=FALSE}
# Using a variable, we try to remove some temporary files whose names start with tmp_
temp_prefix="temp_"
rm "$tmp_prefix"*     # DON'T TRY THIS!
```
  
```{bash, eval=FALSE}
# Using a variable, we try to remove a temporary directory
tempdir=output/tmp
rm -rf $tmpdir/*      # DON'T TRY THIS!
```
  
:::{.callout-caution collapse="true"}
## The comments above specified the _intent_ we had. What would have actually happened?
  
In the first example, `rm "$tmp_prefix"*` would have been interpreted as
`rm *`, because the non-existent variable is simply ignored.
Therefore, we would have removed all files in the current working directory.

Along similar lines, in the second example, `rm -rf $tmpdir/*` would have been interpreted as `rm -rf /*`.
Horrifyingly, this would attempt to remove the entire filesystem
(recall that a leading `/` in a path is a computer's root directory).[^1]

[^1]: But note that at OSC,
you would not be able to remove anything you're not supposed to,
since you don't have the permissions to do so.
On your own computer, this could be more genuinely dangerous, though even there,
you would not be able to remove the operating system without specifically
requesting  "admin" rights.

:::

----

_Second_, a Bash script **keeps running after encountering errors**.
That is, if an error is encountered when running line 2 of a script,
any remaining lines in the script will nevertheless be executed.

In the best case, this is a waste of computer resources,
and in worse cases, it can lead to all kinds of unintended consequences.
Additionally, if your script prints a lot of output,
and much of it _appears_ to be okay,
you might not notice an error somewhere in the middle;
but this error which might still have led to completely wrong results downstream.

----

The following three settings will make your Bash scripts more robust and safer.
With these settings, the script terminates,
with an appropriate error message, if:

- `set -u` &mdash; An unset variable is referenced.
- `set -e` &mdash; Almost any error occurs.
- `set -o pipefail` &mdash; An error occurs in a shell "pipeline"
  (e.g., `sort | uniq`).

We can change all of these settings in one line in a script:

```{bash, eval=FALSE}
set -u -e -o pipefail     # (Don't run in the terminal)
```

Or even more concisely:

```{bash, eval=FALSE}
set -ueo pipefail         # (Don't run in the terminal)
```

### Our header lines as a rudimentary script

Let's go ahead and start a script with the header lines that we have so far
discussed.

- Open a new file in the `VS Code` editor
  (&nbsp; {{< fa bars >}} &nbsp; => &nbsp; `File` &nbsp; => &nbsp; `New File`)
  and save it as `printname.sh`
  (shell scripts, including Bash scripts,
  most commonly have the extension `.sh`).
- Type the following lines in that script
  (please actually type instead of copy-pasting):
  
```{bash, eval=FALSE}
#!/bin/bash
set -ueo pipefail

# (Note: this is a partial script. Don't enter this directly in your terminal.)
```

Already now, we could _run_ (execute) the script.
One way of doing this is calling the `bash` command
followed by the name of the script[^2]:

[^2]: Because our script has a shebang line,
we could also execute the script without the `bash` command using
`./printname.sh`.
However, this would also require us to "make the script executable",
which is beyond the scope of this workshop.

```{bash, eval=FALSE}
bash printname.sh
```

Doing this won't print anything to screen (or file).
This makes sense because our script doesn't have any output,
and as we've seen before with Bash, no output can be a good sign because it
means that no errors were encountered.

<br>

## Command-line arguments for scripts

### Calling a script with arguments

When you call a script, you can pass it command-line arguments,
such as a file to operate on.

This is much like when you provide commands like `ls` with arguments:

```{bash, eval=FALSE}
# Run ls without arguments:
ls

# Pass 1 filename as an argument to ls:
ls data/sampleA.fastq.gz

# Pass 2 filenames as arguments to ls, separated by spaces:
ls data/sampleA.fastq.gz data/sampleB.fastq.gz
```

Let's see the same thing with our `printname.sh` script and a fictional script
`fastqc.sh`
(which would probably run the `FastQC` program --
we'll make such a script later):

```{bash, eval=FALSE}
# Run scripts without any arguments:
bash fastqc.sh                          # (Fictional script)
bash printname.sh

# Run scripts with 1 or 2 arguments:
bash fastqc.sh data/sampleA.fastq.gz    # 1 argument, a filename
bash printname.sh John Doe              # 2 arguments, strings representing names
```

In the next section, we'll see what happens when we pass arguments on the
command line (in short: command-line arguments) to a script.

### Placeholder variables

_Inside_ the script,
any command-line arguments are _automatically assigned_ to placeholder variables.

A first argument will be assigned to the variable `$1`,
any second argument will be assigned to `$2`,
any third argument will be assigned to `$3`, and so on.

:::{.callout-caution collapse="true"}
## In the calls to fastqc.sh and printname.sh above, which placeholder variables were created and what were there values? 

In `bash fastqc.sh data/sampleA.fastq.gz`,
a single argument, `data/sampleA.fastq.gz`, is passed to the script,
and will be assigned to `$1`.

In `bash printname.sh John Doe`,
two arguments are passed to the script:
the first one (`John`) will be stored in `$1`,
and the second one (`Doe`) in `$2`.

:::

:::{.callout-tip}

Arguments passed to a script are _only_ assigned to placeholder varaibles;
unless we explicitly include code in the script to _do_ something with those
variables, nothing else happens. 

:::

Let's add code to our script to "process" any first and last name
that are passed to the script as command-line arguments.
First, our small script will simply `echo` the placeholder variables,
so that we can see what happens.
We'll add two `echo` commands to our `printname.sh` script,
such that the script reads:

```{bash, eval=FALSE}
#!/bin/bash
set -ueo pipefail

echo "First name: $1"
echo "Last name: $2"

# (Note: this is a script. Don't enter this directly in your terminal.)
```

```{bash, eval=TRUE, echo=FALSE}
cat > printname.sh <<'_EOF'
#!/bin/bash
set -ueo pipefail

echo "First name: $1"
echo "Last name: $2"
_EOF
```

Next, we'll _run_ the script, passing the arguments `John` and `Doe`:

```{bash, eval=TRUE}
bash printname.sh John Doe
```

:::{.callout-caution collapse="true"}
## Exercise

In each case below, think about what might happen before you run the script.
If you didn't make a successful predictions, try to figure out what happened
instead.

1. Run the script without passing arguments to it.

2. Deactivate ("comment out") the line with `set` settings
   by inserting a `#` as the first character.
   Then, run the script again without passing arguments to it.

3. Double-quote `John Doe` when you run the script,
   i.e. run `bash printname.sh "John Doe"`

4. Remove the `#` you inserted in the script in step 2 above.

:::{.callout-tip collapse="true"}
## Solutions

1. The script will error out because we are referencing variables that don't
   exist: since we didn't pass command-line arguments to the script,
   the `$1` and `$2` have not been set.

```{bash, eval=FALSE}
bash printname.sh
```

:::{.bash-out}
printname.sh: line 4: $1: unbound variable
:::

2. The script will run in its entirety and not throw any errors,
   because we are now using default Bash settings such that referencing 
   non-existent variables does not throw an error.
   Of course, no names are printed either, since we didn't specify any:

```{bash, eval=TRUE, echo=FALSE}
cat > printname.sh <<'_EOF'
#!/bin/bash
#set -ueo pipefail

echo "First name: $1"
echo "Last name: $2"
_EOF
```

```{bash, eval=TRUE}
bash printname.sh
```

The `set` line should read:

```{bash, eval=FALSE}
#set -ueo pipefail
```

3. Because we are quoting `"John Doe"`,
   both names are passed _as a single argument_ and both names end up in `$1`,
   the "first name":

```{bash, eval=TRUE}
bash printname.sh "John Doe"
```

```{bash, eval=TRUE, echo=FALSE}
cat > printname.sh <<'_EOF'
#!/bin/bash
set -ueo pipefail

echo "First name: $1"
echo "Last name: $2"
_EOF
```

:::

:::

### Descriptive variable names

While you can use the `$1`-style placeholder variables throughout your script,
I find it very useful to copy them to more descriptively named variables
as follows:

```{bash, eval=FALSE}
#!/bin/bash
set -ueo pipefail

first_name=$1
last_name=$2
  
echo "First name: $first_name"
echo "Last name: $last_name"

# (Note: this is a script. Don't enter this directly in your terminal.)
```

Using descriptively named variables in your scripts has several advantages.
It will make your script easier to understand for others and for yourself.
It will also make it less likely that you make errors in your script
in which you use the wrong variable in the wrong place.

:::{.callout-note}
## Other variables that are automatically available inside scripts

- `$0` contains the script's file name
- `$#` contains the _number_ of command-line arguments passed

:::

:::{.callout-caution collapse="true"}
## Exercise: a script to print a specific line

Write a script that prints a specific line (identified by line number)
from a file.

- Save the script as `line.sh`
- Start with the shebang and `set` lines
- Your script takes two arguments: a file name (`$1`) and a line number (`$2`) 
- Copy the `$1` and `$2` variables to descriptively named variables
- To print a specific line,
  think how you might combine `head` and `tail` to do this.
  If you're at a loss, feel free to check out the solution below.
- Test the script by printing line 4 from `samples.txt`.

:::{.callout-tip collapse="true"}
## Solution: how to print a specific line number

For example, to print line 37 of `samples.txt` directly:

```{bash, eval=FALSE}
head -n 37 samples.txt | tail -n 1
```

In the script, you'll have to use variables instead of `37` and `samples.txt`.

How this command works:

- `head -n 37 samples.txt` will print the first 37 lines of `samples.txt`
- We pipe those 37 lines into the `tail` command
- We ask `tail` to just print the last line of its input,
  which will in this case be line 37 of the original input file.

:::

:::{.callout-tip collapse="true"}
## Full solution

```{bash, eval=FALSE}
#!/bin/bash
set -ueo pipefail
  
input_file=$1
line_nr=$2

head -n "$line_nr" "$input_file" | tail -n 1
```

To run the script and make it print the 4th line of `samples.txt`:

```{bash, eval=FALSE}
bash line.sh samples.txt 4
```

## Script variations and improvements

### A script to serve as a starting point

We've learned that the `head` command prints the first lines of a file,
whereas the `tail` command prints the last lines.
Sometimes it's nice to be able to quickly see both ends of a file,
so let's write a little script that can do that for us,
as a starting point for the next few modifications.

Open a new file, save it as `headtail.sh`, and add the following code to it:

```{bash, eval=FALSE}
#!/bin/bash
set -ueo pipefail

input_file=$1

head -n 2 "$input_file"
echo "---"
tail -n 2 "$input_file"

# (Note: this is a script. Don't enter this directly in your terminal.)
```

Next, let's run our `headtail.sh` script:

```{bash, eval=FALSE}
bash headtail.sh samples.txt
```

### Redirecting output to a file

So far, the output of our scripts was printed to screen, e.g.:

- In `printnames.sh`, we simply `echo`'d, inside sentences,
  the arguments passed to the script.
- In `headtail.sh`, we printed the first and last few lines of a file.

All this output was printed to screen because that is the default output
mode of Unix commands,
and this works the same way regardless of whether those commands
are run directly on the command line, or are run inside a script.

Along those same lines, we have already learned that we can "redirect" output
to a file using `>` (write/overwrite) and `>>` (append) when we run shell commands &mdash; and this, too, works exactly the same way inside a script.

-----

When working with genomics data,
we commonly have files as input, and new/modified files as output.
So let's practice with this and modify our `headtail.sh` script so that it
writes output to a file.

We'll make the following changes:

- We will have the script accept a second argument: the output file name.
  Of course, we _could_ also simply write the output to a predefined
  ("hardcoded") file name such as `out.txt`,
  but in general, it's better practice to keep this flexible via an argument.
  
- We will redirect the output of our `head`, `echo`, and `tail` commands to
  the output file. We'll have to append (`>>`) in the last two cases.

```{bash, eval=FALSE}
#!/bin/bash
set -ueo pipefail

input_file=$1
output_file=$2

head -n 2 "$input_file" > "$output_file"
echo "---" >> "$output_file"
tail -n 2 "$input_file" >> "$output_file"

# (Note: this is a script. Don't enter this directly in your terminal.)
```

Now we run the script again, this time also passing the name of an _output_ file:

```{bash, eval=FALSE}
bash headtail.sh samples.txt samples_headtail.txt
```

The script will no longer print any output to screen,
and our output should instead be in `samples_headtail.txt`:

```{bash, eval=FALSE}
# Check that the file exists and was just modified:
ls -lh samples_headtail.txt

# Print the contents of the file to screen
cat samples_headtail.txt
```

### Report what's happening

It is often useful to have your scripts "report" or "log" what is going on.
Let's keep thinking about a script that has file(s) as the main output,
but instead of having no output printed to screen at all,
we'll print some logging output to screen.
For instance: what is the date and time, which arguments were passed to the
script, what are the output files, and perhaps even summaries of the output.
All of this can help with troubleshooting.[^3]

Let's try this with our `headtail.sh` script.

[^3]: Additionally, we'll see in the upcoming `SLURM` module that we when
submit scripts to the OSC queue (rather than running them directly),
the output of scripts that is normally printed to screen,
will instead go to a sort of "log" file.
So, your script's reporting will end up in this file, 
which will help with your record keeping.

```{bash, eval=FALSE}
#!/bin/bash
set -ueo pipefail

## Process command-line arguments
input_file=$1
output_file=$2

## Initial logging 
echo "Starting script $0"           # Print name of script
date                                # Print date & time
echo "Input file:   $input_file"
echo "Output file:  $output_file" 
echo                                # Print empty line to separate initial & final logging

## Print the first and last two lines to a separate file
head -n 2 "$input_file" > "$output_file"
echo "---" >> "$output_file"
tail -n 2 "$input_file" >> "$output_file"

## Final logging
echo "Listing the output file:"
ls -lh "$output_file"
echo "Done with script $0"
date

# (Note: this is a script. Don't enter this directly in your terminal.)
```

A couple of notes about the lines that were added to the script above:

- Printing the `date` at the end of the script as well will allow you to check
  for how long the script ran, which can be informative for longer-running
  scripts.
  
- Printing the input and output files
  (and the command-line arguments more generally) can be particularly useful
  for troubleshooting

- Printing a "marker line" like `Done with script`,
  indicating that the end of the script was reached,
  is handy because due to our `set` settings,
  seeing this line printed means that no errors were encountered.

- Because our script grew so much,
  I also added some comment headers like "Initial logging" to make the script
  easier to read, and such comments can be made more extensive to really explain
  what is being done.

```{bash, eval=TRUE, echo=FALSE}
cat > headtail.sh <<'_EOF'
#!/bin/bash
set -ueo pipefail

## Process command-line arguments
input_file=$1
output_file=$2

## Initial logging 
echo "Starting script $0"
date # Print date & time to log & time running duration
echo "Input file:   $input_file"
echo "Output file:  $output_file"
echo

## Print the first and last two lines to a separate file
head -n 2 "$input_file" > "$output_file"
echo "---" >> "$output_file"
tail -n 2 "$input_file" >> "$output_file"

## Final logging
echo "Listing the output file:"
ls -lh "$output_file"
echo "Done with script $0"
date
_EOF
```

Let's run the script again:

```{bash, eval=TRUE}
bash headtail.sh printname.sh tmp.txt
```

The script printed some details for the output file, but not its contents
(that would have worked here,
but is usually not sensible when working with genomics data).
Let's take a look, though, to make sure the script worked:

```{bash, eval=TRUE}
cat tmp.txt
```

:::{.callout-tip}

The reporting (`echo`-ing) may have started to seem silly for our
litle script, but fairly extensive reporting
(as well as testing, which is outside the scope of this workshop)
can be very useful &mdash; and will be eventually a time-saver.
  
This is especially true for long-running scripts,
or scripts that you often reuse and perhaps share with others.
