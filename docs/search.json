    "text": "Contents of the workshop\nThe workshop is geared towards people who would like to get started with analyzing genomic datasets.\nThe focus of the workshop is not on any specific type of data or analysis, but on general skills for analyzing any genomics dataset, such as from RNAseq, metabarcoding, metagenomic shotgun sequencing, or whole-genome sequencing. These skills boil down to the ability to write small scripts that run command-line programs, and submit these scripts to a remote computer – in our case, the Ohio Supercomputer Center (OSC).\n\nModules of the workshop\n\nIntroduction to the Ohio Supercomputer Center (OSC)\nUsing the VS Code text editor at OSC\nIntroduction to the Unix shell (= the terminal / command line)\nBasics of shell scripts\nSoftware at OSC with modules & Conda\nSubmitting your scripts using the SLURM scheduler\nPutting it all together: practical examples of running analysis jobs at OSC\n\nThe modules will be a mixture of lectures that include “participatory live-coding” (i.e. with the instructor slowly demonstrating and participants expected to follow along for themselves) and exercises.\nWe will work with example genomics data but if you have any, you are also welcome to bring your own data to put your newly learned skills in practice on the last afternoon.\n\n\nSome more background\nWhen doing any kind of large-scale sequencing experiment, you will typically receive the raw sequencing data. Many of the steps to analyze this data, such as those involving quality control, trimming or adapter removal, and assembly or mapping, are best performed using command-line programs. Additionally, a lot of data tends to be involved, and many analysis steps can be done independently for each sample. Therefore, it pays off -or may simply be necessary- to run your analyses not on a laptop or desktop, but at a supercomputer like OSC.\nBeing able to run your analysis at OSC involves a number of skills that may seem overwhelming at first: working in a terminal (the Unix shell); writing scripts to run programs with a command-line interface; submitting scripts to a “queue” & managing the resulting compute jobs; accessing if not also installing software; and having some understanding of the supercomputer.\nFortunately, learning the basics of these skills, so that you can be up-and-running with working on your own genomic data, does not take a lot of time. Keep in mind that these days, excellent programs are available for almost any genomics analysis, so you do not need to be able to code it all up from scratch. You will just need to know how to efficiently run such programs from the command line, which is what this workshop aims to teach you."
