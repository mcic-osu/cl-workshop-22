    "text": "Contents of the workshop\nThe workshop is geared towards researchers at any level that would like to get started with analyzing genomic datasets using command-line programs at the Ohio Supercomputer Center (OSC).\nThis may sound highly specific but virtually any genomic dataset is best analyzed at least in part using command-line programs and, for researchers in Ohio, by using the computing power that OSC offers.\nThe skills you will be taught are foundational and can be applied to working with any kind of (large) dataset. However, on our campus, by far the most common use case for command-line computing at OSC is genomic data – such as from RNAseq, metabarcoding, metagenomic shotgun sequencing, or whole-genome sequencing.\n\nModules of the workshop\n\nIntroduction to the Ohio Supercomputer Center (OSC)\nUsing the VS Code text editor at OSC\nIntroduction to the Unix shell (= the terminal / command line)\nBasics of shell scripts\nData transfer and software at OSC with OSC modules & Conda\nIntroduction to submitting your scripts with SLURM\nPutting it all together: practical examples of running analysis jobs at OSC\n\nThe modules will be a mixture of lectures that include “participatory live-coding” (i.e. with the instructor slowly demonstrating and participants expected to follow along for themselves) and exercises. Thus, the workshop is highly hands-on.\nWe will work with example sequence data (mostly FASTQ files) but you are also welcome to bring your own data to put your newly learned skills in practice on the last afternoon.\n\n\nSome more background\nWhen doing any kind of large-scale sequencing experiment, you will typically receive the raw sequencing data, often in so-called FASTQ files. Many of the steps to analyze this data, such as those involving quality control, trimming or adapter removal, and assembly or mapping, are best performed using command-line programs. Because of the quantity of data involved and the fact that many steps can be done independently for each sample, it moreover pays off (or may simply be necessary) to run this not on a laptop or desktop, but at a supercomputer like OSC.\nBeing able to run your analysis at OSC involves a number of skills that may seem overwhelming at first: working in a terminal (the Unix shell), writing scripts, submitting scripts to a “queue” and managing the resulting compute jobs, accessing if not also installing software, and having some understanding of the supercomputer.\nFortunately, learning the very basics of these skills does not take a lot of time and is sufficient to really be up-and-running with your own genomic data. These days, excellent programs are available for almost any genomics analysis. Therefore, you do not need to be able to code it all up from scratch: you just need to know how to efficiently run these programs at the command line, which is what this workshop aims to teach you."
