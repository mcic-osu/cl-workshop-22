    "text": "This workshop is geared towards people who would like to get started with analyzing genomic datasets.\nIt will be taught in-person with video-linking at the Wooster and Columbus Ohio State campuses, and it is also possible to join online through Zoom. We will have an instructor at each campus: Jelmer Poelstra from the Molecular and Cellular Imaging Center (MCIC) at the Wooster campus, and Mike Sovic from the Center for Applied Plant Sciences (CAPS) at the Columbus campus.\nThe workshop will be highly hands-on and take place across three afternoons:\nWed, Aug 17 - Fri, Aug 19 (Wed & Fri: 1-4:30 pm, Thu: 12-2:30 pm).\n\nAnyone affiliated with The Ohio State University or Wooster USDA is welcome to sign up\nAttendance is free\nNo prior experience with coding or genomic data is required\nYou will need to bring a laptop and don’t need to install anything prior to or during the workshop\nWe will work with example genomics data but if you have any, you are also welcome to bring your own data.\n\nSee below for information about the contents of the workshop and to sign up.\nFor questions, please email Jelmer."

    "text": "Contents of the workshop\nThe focus of the workshop is not on any specific type of data or analysis, but on general skills for analyzing any genomics dataset, such as from RNAseq, metabarcoding, metagenomic shotgun sequencing, or whole-genome sequencing. These skills boil down to the ability to write small scripts that run command-line programs, and submit these scripts to a remote computer – in our case, the Ohio Supercomputer Center (OSC).\n\nModules\n\nIntroduction to the Ohio Supercomputer Center (OSC)\nUsing the VS Code text editor at OSC\nIntroduction to the Unix shell (= the terminal / command line)\nBasics of shell scripts\nSoftware at OSC with modules & Conda\nSubmitting your scripts using the SLURM scheduler\nPutting it all together: practical examples of running analysis jobs at OSC\n\nThe modules will be a mixture of lectures that include “participatory live-coding” (i.e. with the instructor slowly demonstrating and participants expected to follow along for themselves) and exercises.\n\n\nSome more background\nCommand-line programs are preferred for many of the steps to analyze genomic sequencing data, such as those involving quality control, trimming or adapter removal, and assembly or mapping. Other features of such datasets are that they tend to contain a lot of data, and that many analysis steps can be done independently for each sample. It therefore pays off -or may be necessary- to run your analyses not on a laptop or desktop, but at a supercomputer like OSC.\nBeing able to run your analysis with command-line programs at OSC involves a number of skills that may seem overwhelming at first. Fortunately, learning the basics of these skills does not take a lot of time, and will enable you to be up-and-running with working on your own genomic data! Keep in mind that these days, excellent programs are available for almost any genomics analysis, so you do not need to be able to code it all up from scratch. You will just need to know how to efficiently run such programs, which is what this workshop aims to teach you."

There is no real selection procedure: we accept anyone who is at OSU/USDA and signs up before we have reached the maximum number of participants.\nIf we invite you to attend, we will ask you to accept or decline. Before accepting at that point, please make sure you have cleared your calendar for these 3 afternoons – we will likely not be able to accommodate “maybe’s”!\n\nLoading…"
