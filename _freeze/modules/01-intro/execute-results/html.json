Having a basic understanding of a **supercomputer**\n\nAnd being able to:\n\n2. Use the **Unix shell** (work in a terminal)\n3. Write small **shell scripts** that **run command-line programs**\n4. **Submit scripts** to a supercomputer's \"queue\" &mdash;\n   and monitor & manage the resulting batch jobs\n5. Activate and probably install **software** in a Linux environment where you\n   don't have admin rights\n  \nWe will teach the basics of these skills during this workshop!\n\n:::{.callout-caution}\n## What you won't learn\n\nIt may be useful to point out that we will **not** teach you much,\nif anything, about:\n\n- Details of genomic data file types &mdash; except, briefly, FASTQ\n- Details of specific (genomic) analyses\n- Making biological inferences from your data\n:::\n\n<br>\n\n## Practicalities\n\nWe have a slightly complicated set up with participants in-person in Wooster\n~~with an instructor~~ (Jelmer now via Zoom),\nin-person in Columbus with an instructor,\nand directly via Zoom.\nSome notes:\n\n- The workshop consists of a series of **9 modules**:\n  see the [schedule](../index.qmd).\n  We intend to respect the start and end times for every day,\n  but individual modules may take shorter or longer than indicated below.\n  \n- We have one 10-15 minute break between two modules every day,\n  and another impromptu bathroom break in a longer module.\n  \n- The instructors will be available for **additional questions**\n  from about 15 minutes before we start,\n  and for about 30 minutes after we end each day.\n\n- **This website has all the material** that we will go through,\n  with one page for each of module.\n  See the links in the [schedule](../index.qmd) as well as in the top bar menus\n  to access it.\n\n- In-person participants don't need to connect to the Zoom call,\n  since Zoom will be broadcast on the large screen\n  (but you _can_ of course connect\n  if you can better see the instructor's screen that way).\n\n- Because we're not all on Zoom,\n  we'll try to avoid the Zoom chat and instead use\n  **[this Google Doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1M_BSRtnG3QYjntpgxbMENr_ZJGrA35B1e7E0Dn0hK5Q/edit?usp=sharing)**\n  to share links, inpromptu code that is not on the website,\n  and non-urgent questions.\n  \n- Whenever you have a **question**,\n  please feel free to interrupt and speak up,\n  both in-person and on Zoom.\n  Because we will mute the in-person rooms on the Zoom call by default,\n  signal to Mike (Columbus) or Menuka (Wooster) when you have a question,\n  who will then unmute the room.\n  \n  If your question is not urgent and you don't want to interrupt the flow,\n  put it in the Google Doc or ask about it during a break.\n\n<br>\n\n## Sign-up form responses\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](01-intro_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-2-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n<br>\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](01-intro_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-3-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n<br>\n\n## Personal introductions\n\n### Instructors\n\n- **Jelmer Poelstra**, Molecular and Cellular Imaging Center (MCIC), Wooster\n- **Mike Sovic**, Center for Applied Plant Sciences (CAPS), Wooster\n\nA special mention goes out to _Menuka Bhandari_ who is managing the Selby\nin-person room. Menuka is also knowledgeable about the workshop material\nand may be able to help you if you need/prefer someone in the room itself\nfor a certain question.\n\n### Participants\n\nPlease very briefly introduce yourself &mdash;\ninclude your position, department, and why you wanted to go to this workshop.\n",
