Having a basic understanding of a **supercomputer**\n\nAnd being able to:\n\n2. Use the **Unix shell** (work in a terminal)\n3. Write small **shell scripts** that **run command-line programs**\n4. **Submit these scripts** to a supercomputer's \"queue\" and monitor\n   and manage the resulting \"batch jobs\"\n5. Activate and probably install **software** in a Linux environment where you\n   don't have admin rights\n  \nWe will teach the basics of these skills during this workshop!\n\n:::{.callout-caution}\n## What you won't learn\n\nIt may be useful to point out that we will **not** teach you much,\nif anything, about:\n\n- Details of genomic data file types &mdash; except, briefly, FASTQ\n- Details of specific (genomic) analyses\n- Making biological inferences from your data\n:::\n\n<br>\n\n## Mechanics of a hybrid workshop\n\nWe have a slightly complicated set up with participants in-person in Wooster\n~~with an instructor~~ (Jelmer now via Zoom),\nin-person in Columbus with an instructor,\nand directly via Zoom.\nSome notes:\n\n- **This website has all the material** that we will go through during each\n  of the modules!\n  See the links in the schedule as well as in the top bar menus to access it.\n\n- In-person participants don't need to connect to the Zoom call,\n  since Zoom will be broadcast on the large screen\n  (but you _can_ of course connect\n  if you can better see the instructor's screen that way).\n\n- Because we're not all on Zoom, we'll use\n  **[this Google Doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1M_BSRtnG3QYjntpgxbMENr_ZJGrA35B1e7E0Dn0hK5Q/edit?usp=sharing)**\n  to share links, inpromptu code that is not on the website,\n  and non-urgent questions.\n  \n- Whenever you have a **question**,\n  please feel free to interrupt and speak up,\n  both in-person and on Zoom.\n  Because we will mute the in-person rooms on the Zoom call by default,\n  signal to Mike (Columbus) or Menuka (Wooster) tat you have a question,\n  who will unmute.\n  \n  Only if your question is not urgent and you don't want to interrupt the flow,\n  put it in the Google Doc or ask about it during a break.\n\n<br>\n\n## Sign-up form responses\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](01-intro_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-2-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n<br>\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](01-intro_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-3-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n<br>\n\n## Personal introductions\n\n### Instructors\n\n- **Jelmer Poelstra**, Molecular and Cellular Imaging Center (MCIC), Wooster\n- **Mike Sovic**, Center for Applied Plant Sciences (CAPS), Wooster\n\nA special mention goes out to _Menuka Bhandari_ who is managing the Selby\nin-person room. Menuka is also knowledgeable about the workshop material\nand may be able to help you if you need/prefer someone in the room itself\nfor a certain question.\n\n### Participants\n\nPlease very briefly introduce yourself -- \ninclude your position, department, and why you wanted to go to this workshop.\n",
